# This week i struggled as i came across so many errors when trying to use "use client" or "use server" and also with connecting my clerk with my database, however after over coming those errors its just became a time crunch to see how much more i could get done by the deadline, i definetely could have completed all the requirements as they are pretty straight forward however it just took me too long to get past the errors i was getting.

# Aside from those errors, it was just a matter of figuring things out, i wanted to try use an api route so i looked into it and got it working, as well as trying to use the users profile picture and displaying it on the post, apart from that i still needed to work on fixing the css, as i just used an older projects css for this and i still had to implement a primitive component, and a users profile and their posts being displayed in their profile however i just didnt have the time for it.
